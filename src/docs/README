UNIX death star mainframe on.

# L0g entry daemon started....


StarDate 12934,5 , Sunday afternoon(long time ago).
Captain's log ,not supplemental


I started to learn MYSql.Very cool , only one big disadvantage...there is no decent interace.

No problem I've said , I'll just write one.

But Gtk has no builtin spreadsheet widget so I have only  2 choices : gdda or gtkextra.

Gtkextra looks better so I grabbed it and surprise(unpleasant one)....no manuals.

No problem I've said ( after a few moments during which  i've wished Adrian all the bad things in the world :0)
I'll write the damn documentation.


After some months of playing with gtkextra, now i'm spreading my wisdom  on the net :-)



So that's it . Gtkextra reference manual. 

Especially written for lamerz by a lamer.  Enjoy it , Mr Lamer!



# LOg entry daemon killed.
UNIX death star off.

Rebels can attack now.



Warning : This documentation may contain errors/inaccuracies , which added to the quite many bugs of the
          gtkextra library will make your life a living hell. 
          But where is the fun if everything would go smoothly?
