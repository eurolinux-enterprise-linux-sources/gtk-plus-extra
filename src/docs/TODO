

A few things must be done if we want the manual to be useful:

- add some detailed constructive description of the widgets.
- add more examples/screenshots
- add a FAQ/tutorial
- In HELP file you'll find what functions are not covered yet.
  If you can help please send me an email with the description of the function 
  an its parameters.
