  <P
>GtkExtra is a useful set of widgets for creating GUI's for the Xwindows system 
    using GTK+. <br>
    You can use it complementary to GTK+ and it is written in C. It is also Free 
    Software and released under the LGPL license. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The library includes the following widgets: <br>
    <br>
    <strong><font size="4"> GtkSheet </font></strong><br>
  </P
>
  <p>GtkSheet is a matrix widget for GTK+. It consists of an scrollable grid of 
    cells where you can allocate text.<br>
    Cell contents can be edited interactively through a specially designed entry, 
    GtkItemEntry.<br>
    It is also a container subclass, allowing you to display buttons, curves, 
    pixmaps and any other widget in it. <br>
    You can also set many attributes as: border, foreground and background color, 
    text justification, and more. The testgtksheet program shows how easy is to 
    create a spreadsheet-like GUI using this widget set. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><font size="4">GtkPlot</font></strong> <br>
    <br>
    GtkPlot is a widget for GTK+. It allows to draw high quality scientific plots 
    in two dimensions with a look and feel very similar to Microcal Origin for 
    Windows.<br>
    The distribution includes GtkPlotCanvas subclass, and a demo program showing 
    two layered plots with different kind of curves. <br>
    You can choose between a number of symbol types, lines, connectors -straight 
    lines, steps, splines-, and change their attributes -color, size, width-. 
    <br>
    You can also plot functions, add error bars, edit legends, rotate and move 
    axis titles, change axis properties, etc. </p>
  <p>The package also includes GtkPlot3D and GtkPlotPolar. </p>
  <p>GtkPlotCanvas is a GtkFixed subclass and allows to DnD plots, points, and 
    child objects (text, axis titles). You can move them or resize your plots 
    dragging with the mouse! </p>
  <p>The distribution includes also a PostScript driver. </p>
  <p>All the features are demonstrated in testgtkplot and testrealtime. </p>
  <p> <br>
    <strong><font size="4">GtkIconList</font></strong> <br>
    <br>
    GtkIconList is a GtkFixed subclass that allows you to display a table of xpm 
    icons with editable labels. It's completely designed from scratch with some 
    ideas borrowed from gnome-icon-list. It contains almost all of its features 
    and more. It can be used for file browsers and as a replacement of gnome-icon-list 
    (without the need of using gnome libraries). Like GtkSheet, it uses the widget 
    GtkItemEntry to edit the text fields. </p>
  <p> <br>
    <strong><font size="4">GtkDirTree</font></strong> <br>
    <br>
    It is a GtkCTree subclass that allows you to navigate the file-system. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><font size="4">GtkFileList</font></strong> <br>
    <br>
    It is a GtkIconList subclass that displays the contents of a given directory 
    using fancy icons for different types of files. <br>
    <br>
    <font size="4"><strong>GtkIconFileSelection</strong></font> <br>
    <br>
    It is a nice looking file selection dialog using icons. It combines GtkDirTree 
    and GtkFileList to navigate the file system and select files. It has also 
    two entries to select the file and filter. </p>
  <p> <br>
    <strong><font size="4">GtkItemEntry</font></strong> <br>
    <br>
    It is a GtkEntry subclass. It can have fixed size or can be dinamically resized 
    when the text is entered. You can change text justification to centered, left, 
    or right, and change the foreground and background colors very easily. It 
    only displays the text and has no borders. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><font size="4">GtkFontCombo</font></strong> <br>
    <br>
    It is a GtkToolBar subclass with two combos to select among the 35 standard 
    Adobe PostScript fonts with different sizes. <br>
    It has also two buttons to select bold and italics. When you select a new 
    font, it returns the name of the corresponding Postscript font and the equivalent 
    Xfont.<br>
    This is what we all expect to have on the top of a GUI for a spreadsheet or 
    word processor. <br>
  </p>
  <p><strong><font size="4">GtkComboBox</font></strong> <br>
    <br>
    It is a composite widget with two buttons, one with an arrow to display a 
    popdown window where you can pack whatever you want, from a calendar to a 
    clist. <br>
    <br>
    <font size="4"><strong>GtkColorCombo</strong></font> <br>
    <br>
    It is a GtkComboBox subclass with a pallette of colors in the popdown window 
    to pickup the one you like the most. It has a default pallette, but it's completelly 
    customizable. <br>
    <br>
    <font size="4"><strong>GtkBorderCombo</strong></font> <br>
    <br>
    It is a GtkComboBox subclass with a variety of border styles in the popdown 
    window arranged in a table of togglebuttons. <br>
    <br>
    <font size="4"><strong>GtkCheckItem</strong></font> <br>
    <br>
    It is a GtkCheckButton hack with the look and feel of the Redmond95 theme.
